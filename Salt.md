## Papyros is bringing modern features and Material Design to Linux

Our vision for Papyros is building a Linux operating system that is fun and easy to use for the average user. We're doing this by building an operating system that gets out of the user's way, integrates with cloud services and web technologies, and converges across devices and form factors.

## Where are we now?

Papyros is currently in pre-alpha, with an alpha coming this summer. You can find more information (and downloads!) at [papyros.io](http://papyros.io/). You can follow us on [Google+](https://plus.google.com/113262712329378697012) for frequent updates or on [our blog](http://papyros.io/blog) for less frequent but more detailed posts.

All our code is open source and is available on GitHub at <https://github.com/papyros>.

Some of the current features we're working on include:

 * Focus on modern design by conforming to Google's Material Design guidelines
 * A rolling release architecture with atomic upgrades and rollbacks
 * Integration with web apps such as Gmail, Inbox, and Evernote
 * A simple and easy to use desktop environment
 * A cross-platform app development framework based on QtQuick
 * A file manager and settings app for the OS

## We need your support!

Papyros currently has no commercial funding, and development is done by team members and third-party contributors in their spare time. With continual funding, the Papyros team will be able to dedicate more time to working on Papyros as well as pay third-party contributors to work on features and bugs through the use of bug bounties. This will allow me, Michael Spencer, to spend more time as the lead developer building new features of the OS, getting the alpha ready for testing, and working towards stable releases of the operating system. It will also encourage more third-party contributors to get involved with development of the OS.

If you're a developer and would rather earn money by coding rather than paying us to do it for you, check out the [list of open bounties](https://www.bountysource.com/teams/papyros/bounties) and get coding!

## Where does your money go?

With your support, we'd like to continue working towards fulfilling our vision of building an open-source operating system that empowers the user, including building the following features:

 * A selection of core apps that conform to Material Design and integrate tightly with the operating system
 * Intelligent, persistent notifications, similar to the notifications on Android.
 * User account restrictions, useful for parental controls, library and coffee shop computers, and other restricted environments
 * Application bundles and sandboxing, supporting GNOME's work on cross-distro apps and a polished app store
 * Presentation mode, providing a simple way to present to an external display
 * Convergence, or adapting to the device and input methods Papyros is running on.
